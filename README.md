### About Me!

- 🔭 I’m interested in projects that solve real problems and have a clear, positive impact.

- 🌱 Always learning, always up for a challenge.

- 💬 Ask me anything about **Python** - it's my go-to for data, APIs, and fast prototyping.

### 🧭 Projects That Matter

A few things I’ve worked on or am building now:

- 🧳 [Wondur](https://github.com/WondurTravel): During covid 20% of local businesses shut down. This was my first ever endevour and an attempt to fix that!

- 🦇 [Bat-o-Meter](https://github.com/TomSB1423/Bat-O-Meter): An eco initiative to automatically detect and analyse of directionality bats from video input. A request from a friend.

- 📁 [url-2-phone-sms](https://github.com/TomSB1423/url-2-phone-sms): A website to easily transfer files/photos to your computer. A problem I have always had with iPhone & Windows...

- 💡 [wizLightController](https://github.com/TomSB1423/wizLightController): Macro keys to control my smart lights at home

- 📈 Data Workflows: Lightweight ML models with real-world use cases (forecasting, classification, text analysis).

> [!NOTE]
> I care less about fancy demos and more about whether it works, is useful, and can be maintained by the next person.

### 💡 What I Look For

Projects with real-world impact - ideally ones that help people, save time, or solve overlooked problems

Ideas that aren't afraid to go against the grain, if there's a good reason

If you're working on something useful, unusual, or tough to build - I’d love to hear about it.

### 🥾 Outside of Tech

Sometimes the best thinking happens away from the screen.

I recently walked the full length of New Zealand via the Te Araroa trail - 3,040km of remote beaches, forests, mountains, and mud. That kind of challenge teaches you a lot about patience, focus, and staying calm when things get messy - lessons that apply directly to software engineering.
