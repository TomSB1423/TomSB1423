### About Me!

- 🔭 I’m interested in projects that solve real problems and have a clear, positive impact.

- 🌱 Always learning, always up for a challenge.

- 💬 Ask me anything about **Python** - it's my go-to for data, APIs, and fast prototyping.

### 🧭 Projects That Matter

A few things I’ve worked on or am building now:

- 🧳 [Wondur](https://github.com/WondurTravel):  Born during COVID, aimed at helping local businesses recover

- 🦇 [Bat-o-Meter](https://github.com/TomSB1423/Bat-O-Meter): Detecting bat directionality from video input (eco-collab with a friend)

- 📁 [url-2-phone-sms](https://github.com/TomSB1423/url-2-phone-sms): Making it easier to transfer files from my phone to PC. A problem I have always had with iPhone & Windows...

- 💡 [wizLightController](https://github.com/TomSB1423/wizLightController): Macro keys to control my smart lights at home

- 📈 Data Workflows: Lightweight ML models with real-world use cases (forecasting, classification, text analysis).

> [!NOTE]
> I care less about fancy demos and more about whether it works, is useful, and can be maintained by the next person.

### 💡 What I Look For

Projects with real-world impact - tools that help people or solve nagging problems

Ideas that challenge convention for a good reason

If you're working on something useful, unusual, or tough to build - I’d love to hear about it.

### 🥾 Outside of Tech

Sometimes the best debugging happens outdoors.

I recently walked the full length of New Zealand via the Te Araroa trail - 3,040km of remote beaches, forests, mountains, and mud. That kind of challenge teaches you a lot about patience, focus, and staying calm when things get messy - lessons that apply directly to software engineering.
